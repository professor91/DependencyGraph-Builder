# DependencyGraphBuilder

Dependency Graph Builder iterates through each file and tells you that which file depends on what all files and how much it depends on them.

The motive of this project is to give a starting point for a project, to a newbie open source contributor, as he can skim through file with least dependency and build to files with higher dependency and understand which part of the code do what

I have taken <a href="https://github.com/brainboxdotcc/DPP/tree/master/include/dpp">this</a> source code as a reference to build the project.
